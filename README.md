# Film Festival Data
Collecting film festival and box office data

# Questions
## How have festival winners performed at the box office?
- Which award is best? Is it better to win the Jury or the Audience?
- How long do distributors usually wait to release after premiering at a festival?

## How are festivals different from each other?
- Is there a style or pattern in genre or box office return or Rotten scores that is different across festivals?
- If you premiere at Festival A, how likely are you to win at Festival B?
 

Some of these questions have anecdotal answers but can we find patterns within the data even though the time range is pretty short.
